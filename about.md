Started programming in 6th grade. Started with Javascript and quickly moved on to Java. I read Herbert Schildt's Java and C++ Complete References while in middle school. I still love programming languages. Other interests include operating systems, machine learning, and open web technologies.

Salt Lake City native. Graduating from [Brigham Young University](http://byu.edu) in April.

I enjoy running and swimming. I am currently training for a Half Ironman.

I'm a [Mormon](http://www.mormon.org/me/2X41). My faith means a lot to me.
